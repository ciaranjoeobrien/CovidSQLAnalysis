# Covid Analysis
This project is an analysis of the Covid-19 data from various sources, using SQL queries create a view for Tableau visualization. The main goal of this project is to explore the trends and factors that affect the Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations by country, region, and world.

# Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from the following source:
- www.ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

# Data Processing
The data processing steps include:
- Reading the Excel files into SQL tables using SQL Server Management Studio
- Joining the tables on location and date columns using SQL queries
- Creating a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the percentage of population vaccinated by country and region using SQL queries
- Creating a view to join the CTE with other variables for Tableau visualization using SQL queries

# Data Analysis
The data analysis steps include:
- Ordering and grouping the data by various criteria using SQL queries
- Calculating the deaths per case and cases per population ratios using SQL queries
- Ranking the countries and regions by cases, deaths, and vaccinations using SQL queries
- Finding the date with the highest global deaths using SQL queries

# Results
The main results of this project are:
- The global population has experienced a high number of Covid-19 cases and deaths since 2020, with some variations by country and region.
- The chance of death from Covid varies by country, depending on factors such as human development index and vaccination rate.

# Conclusion
The conclusion of this project is:
- The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the health and well-being of the global population.
- The factors that affect the Covid-19 outcomes are mainly related to health care, development, and vaccination.
